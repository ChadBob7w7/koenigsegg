# koenigsegg

”Trevita” is an abbreviation of Swedish words that translates
into “three whites”.

The Koenigsegg visible carbon weave bodywork is unique
and known globally for its perfect pattern and alignment.
Prior to the Trevita, car manufacturers only had access to
traditional black carbon fibre. Koenigsegg developed a
unique coated fiber solution for the Trevita program that
transformed the fibers from black to a sparkling,
silvery-white. When sunlight hits the Trevita, it sparkles as if
millions of tiny white diamonds are infused inside the visible
carbon fiber bodywork.

The Trevita features a unique double carbon rear wing,
inconel exhaust system, carbon ceramic brakes with ABS,
airbags, paddle-shift, chrono instrument cluster,
infotainment system, tire monitoring system and a hydraulic
lifting system.
